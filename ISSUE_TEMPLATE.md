[//]: # "=======================
Instructions for posting issues:
(1) Review what is already there. Perhaps a comment to an existing issue would be more appropriate than opening a new one? Issues can be a topic idea, a cry for help, a to-do, or a discussion / question about OpenCon itself.
(2) Write your post (below this text blob) using Markdown (as per https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/ ) or just plain text. Some quick tips:
* Use # to reference another issue.
* Use @ to tag someone
* - [ ] to tag someone
(3) Hit the 'Submit new issue' button. You can edit after you submit. 

Don't worry about these introductory lines they won't display unless you submit over email.
